Some rubber ducky scripts I have made on my Hak5 Rubber Ducky


Duckycode.txt turns of targets firewall and creates an admin account to set up a remote desktop attack. (for windows 10 and maybe 11 have not tried it)

lang.txt changes the language for the computer. (windows 11)

Backround.bin changes the backround of the computer to a rubber ducky

Shutdown.bin shuts down the computer

To use, make sure to covert to bin if not already done and rename to inject.bin. 
You can use this link to covert. https://ducktoolkit.com/encode 

Then load onto the rubber ducky micro sd card and have fun.
